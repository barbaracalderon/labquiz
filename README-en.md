## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `index.html`: the main HTML file containing the form structure.
- `styles.css`: the CSS file responsible for styling the form.
- `README.md`: this file, providing information about the project.

## Usage Instructions

To use LabQuiz, follow these steps:

1. Download the `index.html` and `styles.css` files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Fill out the form's questions based on your knowledge of HTML and CSS.
4. Click the "Submit" button to submit your answers (only styling is involved!).

## CSS Styles

The CSS styles applied to the form include:

- Centering the text and elements.
- Specific background and text colors for the header, button, and other sections.
- Defining proper sizes and spacing for elements.
- Styling borders and margins to improve the form's appearance.

## Final Considerations

LabQuiz is a simple but useful project for testing and practicing skills related to HTML, CSS, and form design. Developed by me, Barbara Calderon, as an individual activity for the Fullstack course at SENAI/SC - Florian√≥polis, part of the **Floripa Mais Tech** initiative by LAB365.
